Create a full-stack web application in Replit for a global wellness product e-commerce website (healside.net), inspired by casper.com’s modern, simple, and warm design, with a focus on a healing select shop concept. The site should emphasize curated wellness products sourced via dropshipping and wholesale, targeting customers seeking relaxation and well-being. Use pastel blue (#B3CDE0) and neutral beige (#F5F5F5) tones, and incorporate casper.com’s menu structure (Home, Products, Blog, Cart, Login). Follow these specifications:





Project Setup:





Initialize a Node.js project with Express.js for the backend.



Use React.js (via CDN, no create-react-app) for the frontend.



Include Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for styling.



Set up MongoDB (connect to MongoDB Atlas for Replit compatibility).



Install dependencies: express, mongoose, dotenv, stripe, framer-motion, jsonwebtoken.



Frontend (in public/index.html and public/js/app.js):





Create a single-page application with React components, mirroring casper.com’s menu structure:





Header: Sticky navigation bar with logo ("Healside"), menu (Home, Products, Blog, Cart, Login), and a search icon. Use a clean sans-serif font (e.g., Poppins).



Home (Hero): Full-width section with a high-quality image of a wellness product (e.g., aromatherapy diffuser), headline ("Curated Wellness from Around the Globe"), and a CTA button ("Explore Healing"). Add a subtle Framer Motion fade-in effect.



Products: Bento-style grid displaying curated wellness products (e.g., aromatherapy oils, meditation cushions, herbal teas). Each card includes an image, name, price, and "Add to Cart" button. Implement category filters (e.g., Relaxation, Meditation, Skincare).



Blog: Static page with 3 wellness articles (e.g., "The Art of Aromatherapy," "Mindful Meditation Tips," "Global Healing Rituals") to boost SEO and engagement.



Cart: Display selected products, quantities, and total. Include a "Proceed to Checkout" button linked to Stripe.



Login: Simple modal for user login/registration with email and password.



Footer: Links to About (highlighting global sourcing mission), Contact, Privacy Policy, and social media icons (Instagram, Pinterest).



Use Tailwind CSS for a responsive, mobile-first layout with casper.com’s aesthetic: rounded corners, subtle shadows, and generous spacing.



Apply Framer Motion for smooth hover effects on buttons and scroll-triggered animations (e.g., product cards fade in).



Implement lazy-loading for product images to optimize performance.



Backend (in server.js):





Set up an Express.js server with RESTful API endpoints:





GET /api/products: Fetch all products, supporting category filtering (e.g., ?category=relaxation).



GET /api/products/:id: Fetch a single product by ID.



POST /api/cart: Add product to cart (store in MongoDB or session).



POST /api/checkout: Process payment using Stripe API, integrating shipping cost calculation for global delivery.



POST /api/reviews: Submit a product review with rating and comment.



POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate user with JWT.



POST /api/auth/register: Register new user.



Connect to MongoDB Atlas and define schemas:





Product: { id, name, price, description, images, category, supplier }



User: { id, email, password, name, address }



Order: { id, userId, products, total, shippingAddress, status }



Review: { id, productId, userId, rating, comment }



Use dotenv for environment variables (MongoDB URI, Stripe secret key, JWT secret).



Database:





Create a MongoDB database with collections as defined above.



Seed the database with 6 sample wellness products aligned with the select shop concept:





Aromatherapy Oil ($25, Relaxation)



Meditation Cushion ($45, Meditation)



Herbal Tea Blend ($15, Relaxation)



Crystal Healing Set ($35, Spirituality)



Bamboo Diffuser ($50, Relaxation)



Organic Bath Salts ($20, Skincare)



Include supplier info (e.g., "Sourced from Bali" or "Crafted in Japan") to emphasize global curation.



Additional Features:





Implement JWT-based authentication for user login/registration.



Use React Helmet for SEO meta tags (e.g., title: "Healside - Global Wellness Select Shop", description: "Discover curated wellness products for relaxation and healing").



Add a "Why Healside?" section on the Home page, highlighting dropshipping benefits (e.g., "Globally Sourced, Hassle-Free Delivery") and eco-friendly packaging.



Include a review section on product pages with star ratings (1-5) and customer comments, styled like casper.com’s review UI.



Add a "Global Shipping" banner with estimated delivery times (e.g., "US: 5-7 days, Europe: 7-10 days").



Styling Guidelines:





Use Google Fonts (Poppins or Inter) for a modern, approachable feel.



Follow casper.com’s color palette: pastel blue (#B3CDE0) for backgrounds, neutral beige (#F5F5F5) for sections, and orange (#F28C38) for CTA buttons.



Ensure mobile-first design with Tailwind’s responsive classes (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:).



Apply subtle animations (e.g., button scale on hover, section fade-in on scroll) using Framer Motion.



Use high-quality, lifestyle-focused product images with a warm, calming aesthetic.

Replit Configuration:





Add a .replit file with: run = "node server.js"



Ensure the app runs on port 3000 and serves the React frontend.



Test Stripe checkout and MongoDB connectivity in Replit’s environment.



Business Model Integration:





Reflect the dropshipping and wholesale model by including a supplier field in the Product schema and displaying sourcing origins (e.g., "Sourced from Bali") on product pages.



Add a FAQ page (linked in Footer) addressing common dropshipping concerns (e.g., "Why is shipping time longer?" or "How do we ensure quality?").



Optimize for SEO with blog content focused on wellness keywords (e.g., "aromatherapy benefits," "global healing products").

Generate the complete project with all files, including sample data and basic error handling (e.g., 404 for invalid product IDs, 401 for unauthorized access). Ensure the design mimics casper.com’s modern, simple, and warm aesthetic while emphasizing healside.net’s global wellness select shop identity. Test the app in Replit to confirm it runs without errors.
